docker-client-image
===================

This is a Dockerfile forked from https://github.com/tianon/dockerfiles but
intended to be used as a docker client only to the parent docker server.

(to update this image on dockerhub:

1. register an account at https://hub.docker.com/ and get someone who already has one to add you to the "igneoussystems" organization.
2. register a "Trusted Build" on the docker hub

The build is executed by docker on their machines whenever you push to the repo.)
